## 📌 Project Roadmap

- [x] User authentication (JWT-based)
- [x] Quiz result saving

## Static Demo Mode (no backend)

- Set `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` in your `.env.production` (or use the provided `.env.production.example`) so the app skips all backend calls and uses mock leaderboard/history data.
- Build and deploy the frontend (e.g., GitHub Pages); the quiz questions still come from the public OpenTDB API.
- If you want real data later, unset `VITE_DEMO_MODE` and provide `VITE_API_URL` for your deployed API.
